   <p>My name is <strong>Opeyemi  Ijadele</strong>. A student of University of Ibadan. <br>
        My experience so far with Code Imole from the 1<sup>st</sup> of January, 2022
         has been <em> intriguing</em>, helping me in 
        wanting to know more after each session of every training.   
    </p> 
    <p>
        The Code Imole Training has been equipping me and setting me up for the best. <br>
    </p>
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">What I've learnt so far:</h2>
       <p> They are grooming us to one who keeps up to time, for every project you
           managed. <br> I've learnt how to structure a page, give it an heading,
           a title, knowing the element tag of an HTML and as well styling them
           in inlinely, internally and externally using CSS. </p>
